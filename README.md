## Installing dependencies

There are Python, Ruby, and Node dependencies. Using [bundler][]'s `bundle
install` should give you everything you need on the Ruby side, whereas `pip
install -r requirements.txt` should give you all of the Python dependencies.
For node, `npm install purgecss`.

## Deployment

Deployment to S3 and CloudFront invalidation can be done by running `rake
deploy`.

## Stripped fonts

I use a small subset of [Font Awesome][] to provide link icons in the header.
These are stripped using [Fontello][] to only the icons used to minimise
transmission and load time.

I also use two other fonts from [Google Fonts][]: [Open Sans][] and [Droid Sans
Mono][]. These are stored locally in WOFF2.
