Hey there! I'm a kernel developer and SRE, primarily working on Linux kernel
memory management. I work at [Facebook](https://facebook.com) as part of the
Linux Kernel team, and am responsible for kernel-related developments that
improve the overall reliability and performance of Facebook's user-facing
products. In general, my drive is in conceiving, designing, and improving
systems that make Facebook and the wider industry better.

Most of my active work revolves around making operating systems more efficient
at scale, developing things like [the Linux
kernel](https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/project/lkml/list/?submitter=25468&state=%2A&series=&q=&delegate=&archive=both),
[cgroups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikZ8_mRotT4),
[systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd), and a number of other emerging
technologies.

Outside of that, I dabble in
[photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisdown/albums/72157711447135721?layout=justified)
and [sim racing](/racing.html).
